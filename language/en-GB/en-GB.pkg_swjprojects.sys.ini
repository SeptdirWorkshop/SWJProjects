PKG_SWJPROJECTS_WHATS_NEW="<h3>SW JPROJECTS v.1.9.0 What's new?</h3><h4>Hotfix for version</h4><p>According to the semantic versioning standard, numbering consists of 3 main digits. However, sometimes you need to make a hotfix error without changing the version numbering, as this may affect the release plan. Adding the fourth digit is a deviation from the seventh, but in some cases it will make the developer's life easier.</p><h4>Changing the column name in the database</h4><p>Column <code>micro</code> renamed to <code>patch</code>.</p><h4>Fixed</h4><p>Fixed a broken link to download the project from the documentation viewing page.</p><h4>Changes</h4><p>Removed the <code>Itemid</code> parameters from the changelog url and updateserverurl fields in projects.</p><hr/><h3>What is the Joomla version of your developer site?</h3><p>Soon it's time to think about updating the component to the Joomla 4 extension structure. However, it is advisable to understand how many developers have updated their sites to Joomla 4. Suggestions for improving the component and assistance in their implementation are also welcome. I ask all those who are not indifferent to vote by choosing the Joomla version of your site on which SW JProjects is installed and running.</p><p>Please, <a href=\"https://github.com/SeptdirWorkshop/SWJProjects/discussions/103\" target=\"_blank\">go to GitHub discussion</a> and specify the Joomla version of your developer site in the survey.</p>"
